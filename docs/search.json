Several presentation slide classes are available.\nThis is an example of a .paragraph-content class slide. Code can be visually represented using backticks: ``.\nHow to Edit\nThis template is a Quarto presentation. It should be edited through RStudio.\nI would strongly recommend using editor: source rather than editor: visual. Managing classes becomes very clunky in RStudioâ€™s visual editor."
