## Outline

-   Administrative Checks

-   Research Progress

-   Relevant Learning

## Administrative Checks

-   Need to sign Step 2 of the Workplace Safety Training

    -   Online onboarding is done

## Research Progress

-   As the population of British Columbia continues to grow, additional residential development is necessary

-   Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of forest fires in British Columbia

-   Wildfires are inevitable: we need development policy and land use planning that minimizes adverse environmental exposure

-   Research Question

    -   How are wildfire outcomes shaped by different types of residential development near the wildland-urban interface?

-   Strong literature review progress, organizing in Zotero for export to BibLaTeX

## Data

-   Incident-specific wildfire suppression costs are out there! I have annual costs & Section 25 letters [@macmillan_modeling_2022]

    -   Scoured all governmental websites including FOI requests for the BCWFS data referenced

    -   Contacting corresponding author Lili Sun

-   Is data needed on property losses, business interruptions, and rebuilding, or should we just focus on suppression costs?

-   Found spatial climate models, WUI risk classification, danger rating, historical wildfire perimeters, air quality impact, spectral change magnitude, land use maps, time series forest coverage, and more

-   For modeling: need map of residential development types near WUI, may need to use computer vision

## Methods

-   Nonparametric machine learning for assessing incident-specific wildfire suppression costs

    -   Random forests

    -   Distance from fire perimeter to WUI: identify closest point, then generate % of nearby residential development types

    -   This will work with empirical data to give variable importance when considering residential development types

-   Downside: causality is hard to interpret with machine learning models

## Modeling

-   Model works best when approximating an aggregate of many wildfire incidents

-   Can use risk map with Monte-Carlo models to generate an expected suppression expenditure surface map (directly recommended by [@macmillan_modeling_2022])

    -   Rather than making an idealized set of developments, we make a large set of modeled fires informed by climate predictions

    -   Model will give insight into relative resilience today and potential future outcomes

-   Have researched other possible modeling approaches, am still considering:

    -   Coupled fuel-atmospheric modeling

    -   3D computational fluid mechanics

    -   Euler Level-Set

## Relevant Learning

-   Theory behind Machine Learning

-   Convolutions in Probability Theory

-   Graph Theory

-   Computer Vision

## Next Steps

-   Starting with empirical approach first:

    -   Can generate insights from the data which will better inform the model

    -   Parallel to grounded theory in qualitative data coding

    -   Gets my hands dirty sooner

-   Reaching out to Lili Sun, corresponding author of Macmillan et al. 2022

-   Reaching out to Devona Hay: whether dataset with Protected-B security classification contains incident-specific costs [@noauthor_bc_nodate-5]
