## Template Overview {.paragraph-content}

<b>Template Purpose</b>

The goal of this document is to provide a helpful, easily editable template for UBC students, staff, and faculty. Several presentation slide classes are available.

This is an example of a `.paragraph-content` class slide. Code can be visually represented using backticks: ``.

<b>How to Edit</b>

This template is a Quarto presentation. It should be edited through RStudio.

I would strongly recommend using `editor: source` rather than `editor: visual`. Managing classes becomes very clunky in RStudio's visual editor.

## Roadmap {.roadmap}

This is an example of a `.roadmap` class slide. Sections can be separated with `class = "break"`.

<b>Objective 1</b>

<ol>
  <li>Slide 1</li>
  <li>Slide 2</li>
</ol>

<div class = "break"><br></div>

<b>Objective 2</b>

<ol>
  <li>Slide 1</li>
  <li>Slide 2</li>
</ol>

# Thank you! {.thanks}

This is an example of a `.thanks` class slide.

<div class = "break"><br></div>

I appreciate your interest in this template.
